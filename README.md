## Technical Requirements:
In order to start your Flutter adventure, you will need a few tools: 
- A GitHub account
- GitHub Copilot - Your AI pair programmer to help you write code faster 
- An Android/iOS setup. You'll need to set up your Android and iOS environments to build apps. 
- The Flutter SDK. It's free, light, and open source 
Physical device/emulator/simulator. In order to try your code, you will need an Android or iOS device.
- Alternatively, you can also install an Android emulator or iOS simulator. 
- Your favorite editor. The supported editors at this time are: 
- Android Studio. It's the easiest way to install the Android SDK and emulators.
